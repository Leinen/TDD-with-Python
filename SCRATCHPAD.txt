DEPLOYMENT CHAPTERS OVERVIEW
There’s lots of stuff in the next three chapters, so here’s an overview to help you keep your bearings:

This chapter: getting a basic manual deployment up and running

	Adapt our FTs so they can run against a staging server.

	Spin up a server, install all the required software on it, and point our staging and live domains at it.

	Upload our code to the server using Git.

	Try and get a quick-and-dirty version of our site running on the staging domain using the Django dev server.

	Set up a virtualenv on the server and make sure the database and static files are working.

	As we go, we’ll keep running our FT, to tell us what’s working and what’s not.

Next chapter: moving to a production-ready config

	Move from our quick-and-dirty version to a production-ready configuration.

	Stop using the Django dev server, use Nginx and Gunicorn as web servers, configure efficient static file serving, set our app to start automatically on boot with Systemd.

	Security: Use environment variables to DEBUG to False, change the SECRET_KEY, and so on

Third deployment chapter: automating the deployment

	Once we have a working config, we’ll write a script to automate the process we’ve just been through manually, so that we can deploy our site automatically in future.

	Finally we’ll use this script to deploy the production version of our site on its real domain.
